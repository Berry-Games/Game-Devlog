## ðŸ“Œ Notes / Thoughts

- I feel like i am rushing through the learning material and not fully absorbing everything. I should start revising topics and definitions with ankidroid flash cards.
- In exercises i feel like i am doing pretty good, but when i see the answer i always feel like "Why didn't i think of that, that is so simple!" I need to practice more.
- Made some ankidroid cards. When i am free I should try to revise them
- Started to do some raylib projects. I should try to do all the examples in the site.
- I wasted a whole day trying to use std::println function which is available in c++23. But i can't use it with GCC or mingw. I cant update my GCC in linux and mingw for windows dont even have it even though it is GCC 15.2. I could've tried another way but i gave up.
- Actually finished more than target for September 2025. But from next week i'll get busy and there are lot more than coding i need to do (pixel art, story writing). I hope atleast i can do one chapter a week.
