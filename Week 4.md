## ðŸ“Œ Notes / Thoughts

- Chapter O was optional. so i did not do the exercise with effort. i just glanced the topics. Hopefully wont need it for my games.
- Chapter 7 & 8 finished. Learned a lot of topics. I feel little overwhelmed because there is so many ways to do simple things and i don't know which one to pick. All I do is write the program first and see where i can improve it. Reduce logic, reduce unnecessary variable.
- I had a lot of time this week. from the next week onwards i am gonna do once chapter per week and one Raylib example per week.
- I also want to do more exercise so i was thinking if i should read PPP 3E, now that i know about at least some basics, and do all the exercise there. I also want to share my solution to the problems and ask someone for any comments or improvements
- I did some coding in raylib. I seem to understand some of it but i had so many doubts and in the end i just asked chatgpt a lot of questions to fix the problem. Also code blocks just crashes sometimes even though i am doing very minimal coding. i feel like i need a better laptop to even code simple program. I felt little demotivated. Because i need to wait lot more years to get another laptop.
