## ðŸ“Œ Notes / Thoughts

- This week was really busy. That's why i could not upload the devlog on Sunday. I have more time this week maybe i'll finish chapter 5 and 6.
- I finished chapter 3 which was about debugger which did not have any exercise but i wanted to do some thing to feel like i am learning so i went ahead and finished chapter 4 this week.
- I stopped using Clion because it got really slow on my laptop and started using Code::Blocks. It took me a while to setup compiler with c++23 support in Code::Blocks but i got it.
